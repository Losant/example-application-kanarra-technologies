          This application demonstrates a nested, multi-tenant, experience built and hosted entirely within the
          Losant platform. For this example, Kanarra Technologies is a manufacturer of industrial power generators
          that are sold to hospitals chains. These hospitals chains are divided into geographic regions each containing
          multiple facilities. Users assigned to groups within this hierarchy are able to see the real-time and
          historical performance data of devices associated with that group and any of its children. This application
          allows Kanarra to offer a subscription service while empowering their customers with greater transparency
          into the equipment theyâ€™ve purchased.
