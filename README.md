# Example Losant Application - Kanarra Technologies

This application template demonstrates a nested, multi-tenant, IoT experience built and hosted entirely within the [Losant Enterprise IoT Platform](https://www.losant.com).

For this example, Kanarra Technologies is a hypothetical manufacturer of industrial power generators that are sold to hospitals chains. These hospitals chains are divided into geographic regions each containing multiple facilities. Users assigned to groups within this hierarchy are able to see the real-time and historical performance data of devices associated with that group and any of its children. This application allows Kanarra to offer a subscription service while empowering their customers with greater transparency into the equipment theyâ€™ve purchased.
